# Sample Hydrosphere Kubeflow Pipelines

This folder contains example pipelines which use
[Hydrosphere Components for KFP](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/components/hydrosphere).


The following sections explain the setup needed to run these pipelines.
Once you are done with the setup,
[simple-deployment-pipeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples/contrib/hydrosphere-samples/simple-deployment-pipeline)
is a good place to start if you have never used these components before.
